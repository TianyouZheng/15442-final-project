To determine the range of values for \\(a\\) such that the function \\(f(x) = \\log_2(x^2 - ax + 3a)\\) is an increasing function on the interval \\([2, +\\infty)\\), we need to analyze the properties of the logarithmic function and the quadratic expression inside it.\n\n1. **Identify the conditions for the logarithmic function to be increasing:**\n   The function \\(f(x) = \\log_2(g(x))\\) is increasing if \\(g(x) = x^2 - ax + 3a\\) is increasing and positive on the interval \\([2, +\\infty)\\).\n\n2. **Determine the conditions for the quadratic function to be increasing and positive:**\n   - The quadratic function \\(g(x) = x^2 - ax + 3a\\) is a parabola opening upwards (since the coefficient of \\(x^2\\) is positive). For \\(g(x)\\) to be increasing on \\([2, +\\infty)\\), the vertex of the parabola must be to the left of \\(x = 2\\). The vertex of the parabola is at \\(x = \\frac{a}{2}\\). Therefore, we need \\(\\frac{a}{2} \\leq 2\\), which simplifies to \\(a \\leq 4\\).\n   - Additionally, \\(g(x)\\) must be positive for all \\(x \\geq 2\\). Specifically, \\(g(2) > 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\\). Substituting \\(x = 2\\) into \\(g(x)\\), we get:\n   \\[\n   g(2) = 2^2 - 2a + 3a = 4 + a > 0 2\n   \\]\n   This simplifies to \\(a > -2\\).\n\n3. **Combine the conditions:::\n   The conditions \\(a \\leq 4\\) and \\(a > -2\\) combine to give the range of \\(a\\) as \\(-2 < a \\leq 4\\).\n\nTherefore, the range of values for \\(a\\) is \\(\\boxed{(-2, 4]}\\).", "prediction": null, "match": false, "label": 8}
