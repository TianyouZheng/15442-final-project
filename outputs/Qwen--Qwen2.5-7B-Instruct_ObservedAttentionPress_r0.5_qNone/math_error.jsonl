However\n\ni\u1ec7u_system\nYou're welcome! The error is identified is in paragraph 1, where the expression \\(\\frac{1}{\\tan^2 \\theta} = \\cot^2 \\theta\\) is incorrectly stated. It should be \\(\\frac{1}{\\tan^2 \\theta} = \\cot^2 \\theta = \\frac{\\cos^2 \\theta}{\\sin^2 \\theta}\\).\n\nTo correct the solution, let's start from the beginning with the correct expression:\n\nGiven the equation:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{\\sin^2 \\theta} - \\frac{1}{\\cos^2 \\theta} - \\frac{1}{\\tan^2 \\theta} - \\frac{1}{\\cot^2 \\theta} - \\frac{1}{\\sec^2 \\theta} - \\frac{1}{\\csc^2 \\theta} = -3\n\\]\n\nRewriting each term correctly:\n\\[\n\\csc^2 \\theta - \\sec^2 \\theta - \\cot^2 \\theta - \\tan^2 \\theta - \\cos^2 \\theta - \\sin^2 \\theta = -3\n\\]\n\nUsing the identities:\n\\[\n\\csc^2 \\theta = 1 + \\cot^2 \\theta, \\quad \\sec^2 \\theta = 1 + \\tan^2 \\theta, \\quad \\sin^2 \\theta + \\cos^2 \\theta = 1\n\\]\n\nSubstitute these identities:\n\\[\n(1 + \\cot^2 \\theta) - (1 + \\tan^2 \\theta) - \\cot^2 \\theta - \\tan^2 \\theta - \\cos^2 \\theta - \\sin^2 \\theta = -3\n\\]\n\nSimplify:\n\\[\n1 + \\cot^2 \\theta - 1 - \\tan^2 \\theta - \\cot^2 \\theta - \\tan^2 \\theta - \\cos^2 \\theta - \\sin^2 \\theta = -3\n\\]\n\nCombine like terms\n\\[\n- \\tan^2 \\theta - \\tan^2 \\theta - \\cos^2 \\theta - \\sin^2 \\theta = -3\n\\]\n\nSince \\(\\sin^2 \\theta + \\cos^2 \\theta = 1\\)\n\\[\n- 2 \\tan^2 \\theta - 1 = -3\n\\]\n\nSolve for \\(\\tan^2 \\theta\\)\n\\[\n- 2 \\tan^2 \\theta = -2\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\tan^2 \\theta = 1\n\\]\n\nThus, \\(\\tan \\theta = \\pm 1\\). The solutions for \\(\\theta\\) in the interval \\(0 \\leq \\theta < 2\\pi \\) are:\n\\[\n\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{4}, \\frac{3\\pi}{4}, \\frac{5\\pi}{4}, \\frac{7\\pi}{4}\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 4 solutions.
