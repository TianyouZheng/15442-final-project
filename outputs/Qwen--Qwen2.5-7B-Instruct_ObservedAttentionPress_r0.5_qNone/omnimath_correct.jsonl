However, the next step of expanding \\((p-1)^p\\) using the binomial theorem is unnecessary and can be simplified. The paragraph should directly state that \\((p-1)^p + 1 \\equiv 0 + 1 \\pmod{p}\\), which simplifies to \\(1 \\pmod{p}\\), and thus \\(p\\) does not divide \\((p-1)^p + 1\\).\n\n3. **Paragraph 3:**\n   - The paragraph correctly identifies that for \\(p = 2\\), \\((2, 2)\\) is a solution. For \\(p = 3\\), \\((3, 3)\\) is also a solution. The paragraph should be more concise and directly state these findings without the binomial expansion.\n\n4. **Paragraph 4:**\n   - The paragraph correctly considers the case when \\(x = 2p\\). However, the statement \" \\((2p)^{p-1}\\) divides \\((p-1)^{2p} + 1\\)\" is not immediately clear. The paragraph should clarify that \\((2p)^{p-1}\\) is a power of \\(2p\\), and we need to check the divisibility of \\((p-1)^{2p} + 1\\) by \\((2p)^{p-1}\\). The paragraph should directly state that for \\(p > 2\\), \\((2p)^{p-1}\\) does not divide \\((p-1)^{2p} + 1\\).\n\n5. **Paragraph 5:**\n   - The paragraph correctly states that for \\(2 < x < p\\) or \\(p < x < 2p\\), the cases are not solutions. The paragraph should be more concise and directly state these findings.\n\n6. **Paragraph 6:**\n   - The paragraph correctly concludes that the only solutions are \\((1, p)\\) for any prime \\(p\\), \\((2, 2)\\), and \\((3, 3)\\).
