{"config": "math", "generated_critique": "\\boxed{1}\n\nThe earliest error is found in paragraph 1. The possible multiples of 13 considered are 13 and 26. However, 26 should not be considered as a possible value for \\(G\\) because it would imply \\(B = 35 - 26 = 9\\), and in this case, \\(G\\) is not greater than \\(B\\). The correct approach is to consider only 13 as a possible value for \\(G\\) and then check if it satisfies the conditions. Since 13 does not satisfy \\(G > B\\), the next possible multiple, 26, should be considered, but it is not a valid multiple as it would imply an unusually large number of girls. The correct multiple to consider is 26, which gives \\(B = 9\\), and satisfies all the conditions.", "prediction": 1, "match": false, "label": -1}

The fraction \\(\\frac{57}{991}\\) should be \\(\\frac{57}{990}\\) (assuming the number is 991 was a typo and should be 990). However, the main issue is that the simplification step is incorrect.
