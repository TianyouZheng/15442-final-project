The logic for the next Monday's distance should be calculated from the previous Sunday's distance, not the previous Tuesday's distance. The correct calculation for the next Monday should be \\(3500 + 550 = 4000\\) meters, and the next Tuesday should be \\(4000 + 550 = 4550\\) meters, but the problem asks for 4500 meters, which is is correctly reached on the next Tuesday after the initial Monday.
