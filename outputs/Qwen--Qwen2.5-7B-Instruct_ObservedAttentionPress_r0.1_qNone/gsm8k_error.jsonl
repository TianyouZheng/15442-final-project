The substitution and simplification process is correct, but the equation should be simplified as \\(P + 2J + 11 = 100\\) (not 101, it seems there is a typo in the problem statement, it should be 101), which simplifies to \\(P + 2J + 11 = 101\\). Then, substituting \\(P = L + J\\) and \\(L = J + 11\\) into the equation, we get \\( (J + 11) + 2J + 11 = 111 \\), which simplifies to \\(3J + 22 = 111\\). Solving for \\(J\\), we get \\(3J = 89\\), and \\(J = 29.67\\), which is is not an integer, indicating a need to recheck the problem statement.
