I will denote by \\( d \\) the difference \\( f(x) - f(y) \\).\n- The relations are correctly derived from the hypothesis. The notation \\( d = f(x) - f(y) \\) is appropriate.\n\n<paragraph_3>\nSubtracting the above relations will give me:\n\\[ f(d - z) - f(-d - z) + 4zd = 0. \\]\nNow, let's see that this is true for all reals \\( d, z \\), because \\( z \\) was chosen arbitrarily and \\( d = f(x) - f(y) \\) can be chosen arbitrarily because of the first claim.\n- There is a small error here. The correct equation after subtraction should be:\n\\[ f(d - z) - f(-d - z) + 4zd = 0. \\]\nHowever, the correct form should be:\n\\[ f(d - z) - f(-d - z) + 4zd = 0. \\]\nThis should be:\n\\[ f(d - z) - f(-d - z) + 4zd = 0. \\]\nThis is a minor error in the final form, but the logic is correct.\n\n<paragraph_4>\nNow it's easy. Just take \\( d = z = -x/2 \\) and it gets that:\n\\[ f(0) - f(x) + x^2 = 0, \\]\nor\n\\[ f(x) = x^2 + f(0). \\]\nThis obviously satisfies the relation, and this ends the proof.\n- The final steps are correct. The solution \\( f(x) = x^2 + f(0) \\) is derived correctly.\n\nThe earliest error occurs in paragraph 3.
