The weight of the carrots is correctly calculated as 10 - 3 = 7 pounds.\n\n<paragraph_2>\nTo find out how many pounds of carrots Daisy bought, we need to add up the weights of the potatoes, sweet potatoes, and carrots: 5 + 10 + 7 = 22 pounds. The answer is: $\\boxed{22}$.\n</paragraph_2>\n\nThis paragraph contains an error. The problem specifically asks for the weight of the carrots, not the total weight of all the vegetables. The correct answer should be just the weight of the carrots, which is 7 pounds.\n\nSince the error is in paragraph 2, the index of the paragraph where the earliest error occurs is \\boxed{2}.", "prediction": 2, "match": true, "label": 2}
