In this case, \\( \\frac{m}{m-1} > 2 \\), so \\( n \\leq \\frac{m}{m-1} \\) implies that \\( n < 2 \\). However, if \\( n=1 \\), then \\( m \\cdot n = m > m + n \\), so \\( n \\) cannot be equal to 1. Therefore, we must have that \\( n=2 \\), and \\( m \\cdot n = 2m \\leq m + 2 \\). This inequality holds for all positive integers \\( m \\), since \\( 2m \\leq m + 2 \\) is equivalent to \\( m \\leq 2 \\), which is true for all positive integers.\n</paragraph_2>\n\nThis paragraph contains an error. The inequality \\(2m \\leq m + 2\\) is not true for all positive integers \\(m\\). It is only true for \\(m \\leq 2\\). For \\(m > 2\\), the inequality \\(2m > m + 2\\) holds, which means \\(n\\) cannot be 2.

Since the area of a square is given by the formula $s^2$, where $s$ is the length of a side, we can find the length of a side by taking the square root of $49$. Thus, the length of each side of the square is $\\sqrt{49} = 7$ inches.\n</paragraph_1>\n\nThis paragraph is correct.\n\n<paragraph_2>\nSecond, when the paper is folded such that one pair of opposite corners coincide, the fold line becomes the perpendicular bisector of the diagonal of the square.

To find the length of the diagonal, we use the Pythagorean theorem for the square: $d^2 = s^2 + s^2 = 7^2 + 7^2 = 98$.

For our triangle, one side is $7$ inches (the side of the square), another side is $7$ inches (another side of the square), and the third side is $\\frac{7\\sqrt{2}}{2}$ inches (half the diagonal). Adding these together gives the perimeter: \\[P = 7 + 7 + \\frac{7\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\] \\[P = 14 + \\frac{7\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\] To simplify, we can express it with a common denominator: \\[P = \\frac{28}{2} + \\frac{7\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\] \\[P = \\frac{28 + 7\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\]\n</paragraph_4>\n\nThis paragraph contains an error.
