The correct equation should be \\(W + V + 95^\\circ = 180^\\circ\\), but the angle \\(\\angle AMC\\) is not \\(95^\\circ\\). It is given that \\(\\angle AMC = T^\\circ = 95^\\circ\\), but the angle \\(\\angle AMC\\) in the triangle \\(AMC\\) is actually \\(180^\\circ - 95^\\circ = 85^\\circ\\). So, the correct equation is \\(W + V = 85^\\circ\\).\n\n<paragraph_2>\nRemembering that \\(W = \\frac{1}{3}\\angle BAC\\), and knowing that in any triangle the sum of the angles is \\(180^\\circ\\), we have:\n\\[\\angle BAC + 2V = 180^\\circ\\]\n\\[\\angle BAC = 180^\\circ - 2V\\]\n**Analysis:** This paragraph is correct.\n\n<paragraph_3>\nSince \\(W = \\frac{1}{3}\\angle BAC\\), we can substitute for \\(\\angle BAC\\):\n\\[W = \\frac{1}{3}(180^\\circ - 2V)\\]\n**Analysis:** This paragraph is correct.\n\n<paragraph_4>\nBut from our previous equation, we have \\(W + V = 85^\\circ\\). Substituting for \\(W\\) gives:\n\\[\\frac{1}{3}(180^\\circ - 2V) + V = 85^\\circ\\]\n**Analysis:** This paragraph is correct.\n\n<paragraph_5>\nMultiplying both sides by 3 to clear the fraction:\n\\[180^\\circ - 2V + 3V = 255^\\circ\\]\n**Analysis:** The error occurs here. The correct equation after multiplying by 3 is \\(180^\\circ - 2V + 3V = 255^\\circ\\), but it should be \\(180^\\circ - 2V + 3V = 255^\\circ - 85^\\circ = 180^\\circ\\).\n\n<paragraph_6>\nSimplifying this yields:\n\\[V = 75^\\circ\\]\n**Analysis:** The error occurs here. The correct simplification is \\(V = 75^\\circ\\).\n\n<paragraph_7>\nThus, the measure of angle \\(ACB\\) is \\(V = 75^\\circ\\). Therefore, \\(U = 75^\\circ\\). \\[ \\boxed{75} \\]\n**Analysis:** The final answer is correct, but the error in paragraph 1 and paragraph 5 needs to be noted.\n\nThe earliest error occurs in paragraph 1.
