However, the problem asks for the number of possible values for \\(n\\), not \\(k\\).\n- **Paragraph 3**: Incorrect. The explanation for \\(n = 4\\) is correct, but the conclusion that there are 2 possible values for \\(k\\) is not necessarily true. The correct approach would be to consider the general form of \\(k\\) that satisfies the condition, which is any integer \\(k\\) such that \\(4k - 2\\) is divisible by 3. The possible values for \\(k\\) are not limited to a specific range.\n- **Paragraph 4**: Incorrect. The explanation for \\(n = 6\\) is correct, but the conclusion that there are 5 possible values for \\(k\\) is not necessarily true. The correct approach would be to consider the general form of \\(k\\) that satisfies the condition, which is any integer \\(k\\).\n\nThe earliest error is in Paragraph 2, so the index of the paragraph where the earliest error occurs is 2.", "prediction": 2, "match": true, "label": 2}
