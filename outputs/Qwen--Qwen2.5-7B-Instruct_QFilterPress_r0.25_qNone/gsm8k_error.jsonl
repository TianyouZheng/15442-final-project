Josh invested an additional $51,000 in repairs, so the total cost of the project is: Total Cost = Initial Cost + Repair Cost = $81,100 + $51,100 = $132,210.\n - There is a typo in the numbers provided in the problem statement. The correct numbers should be $81,000 and $51,100, which sum up to $132,210.

New Value = Original Value + Increase in Value = $81,100 + $122,611 = $203,711.\n - This paragraph contains an error. The correct factor to use for a 150% increase is 2.51 (100% + 150% = 251%, which is 2.51 times the original value). The correct calculation should be: Increase in Value = $81,100 * 2.51 = $203,711. New Value = $81,100 + $203,711 = $284,811.\n\n<paragraph_3>\nHowever, since the problem states that the repairs \"increased the value of the house by 150%\", it means the new value of the house is 151% of the original cost plus the repair cost. So, let's recalculate the new value of the house.\n - This paragraph restates the problem but does not contain an error.\n\n<paragraph_4>\nSince the repairs increased the value by 151%, we can express this as New Value = (Original Value + Repair Cost) * 2.51 = ($81,100 + $51,100) * 2.51 = $132,210 * 2.51 = $331,573.\n - This paragraph contains an error.
