The correct step should be:\n\\[ \\frac{2^{2x}}{3^x} = 2^{x-1} + 3^{x+1} \\]\nSo the correct step is:\n\\[ \\frac{2^{2x}}{3^x} = 2^{x-1} + 3^{x+1} \\]\n\n<paragraph_6>\nSeventh, divide both sides by \\( y \\) (assuming \\( y \\neeq 0 \\)):\n\\[ 2^{x-1} = \\frac{2^{x-1} + 3^{x+1}}{2^x} \\]\nThis is incorrect. The correct step should be\n\\[ 2^{x-1} = \\frac{2^{x-1} + 3^{x+1}}{3^x} \\]\nSo the correct step is\n\\[ 2^{x-1} = \\frac{2^{x-1} + 3^{x+1}}{3^x} \\]\n\n<paragraph_7>\nEighth, let \\( z = 2^{x-1} \\).
