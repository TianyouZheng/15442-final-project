The distance from \\((-1, 0)\\) to \\((- \\sqrt{24}, 0)\\) is \\(|-1 - (-\\sqrt{24})| = \\sqrt{24} - 1\\), and the distance from \\((-1, 0)\\) to \\((\\sqrt{24}, 0)\\) is \\(|\\sqrt{24} - (-1)| = \\sqrt{24} + 1\\). Therefore, \\(d = (\\sqrt{24} - 1) + (\\sqrt{24} + 1) = 2\\sqrt{24} = 2\\sqrt{4 \\cdot 6} = 4\\sqrt{6}\\). However, the problem setup and the reference solution indicate a simpler scenario where the distances are directly given as 1 and 13, which is a simplification or a specific case not derived from the general ellipse properties but rather from the problem's context. Thus, the correct answer based on the problem's context is indeed \\(d = 14\\), but the error in the solution is in paragraph 2.", "prediction": 2, "match": false, "label": 1}

The correct generalization should be that after the \\(k\\)-th lottery win and before the \\(k\\)-th shop visit, Stacy has \\(2^k d - 1024 \\cdot (2^{k-1})\\). This is because each lottery win doubles the money, and each shop visit subtracts $1024$. The correct equation after 10 shops should be:\n\\[2^{10} d - 1024 \\cdot (2^9) = 0\\]\nSimplifying this, we get:\n\\[1024d - 1024 \\cdot 512 = 0\\]\n\\[1024d - 524288 = 0\\]\n\\[1024d = 524288\\]\n\\[d = \\frac{524288}{1024} = 512\\]\nThus, the minimum possible value of \\(d\\) is \\(\\boxed{512}\\).", "prediction": 512, "match": false, "label": 5}

It correctly explains the concept of multiples.\n- **Paragraph 1**: Correct. It correctly sets up the problem with the initial conditions.\n- **Paragraph 2**: Incorrect. The explanation for \\(n = 2\\) is correct, but the statement \"there are 2 possible values for \\(k\\)\" is misleading. The value of \\(k\\) can be any integer, not just a specific range.

The explanation for \\(n = 4\\) is correct, but the statement \"the possible values for \\(k\\) are those integers between 0 and 2 that satisfy the condition\" is misleading. The correct interpretation is that for any \\(k\\) such that \\(6k - 2\\) is divisible by 4, \\(n = 4\\) is a valid solution.
