Let's go through each paragraph to identify and correct them:\n\n<paragraph_0>\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the total number of strictly increasing subsequences of length 2 or more in all possible arrangements of 6 distinct numbers. Let's denote the six distinct numbers as \\(a_1 < a_2 < a_3 < a_4 < a_5 < a_6\\).\n</paragraph_1>\n\nThis paragraph is correct.\n\n<paragraph_1>\n**Step 1: Counting Increasing Subsequences**\nWe know that for a sequence of length \\(n\\), the number of ways to choose an increasing subsequence of length \\(k\\) is given by the binomial coefficient \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\). However, since we're interested in subsequences of length 2 or more, we must calculate the sum for all possible lengths from 2 to 6 and then multiply it by the number of ways to arrange the chosen elements (since the elements are distinct). However, in this case, we don't actually need to calculate the specific combinations; instead, we can use symmetry and counting principles.\n</paragraph_1>\n\nThe paragraph is correct, but the explanation can be simplified. The key point is that we need to sum the contributions of all possible subsequences of length 2 or more.\n\n<paragraph_2>\n**Step 2: Understanding Symmetry**\nConsider a single pair of numbers, say \\(a_i\\) and \\(a_j\\) where \\(i < j\\). Every time these two numbers appear in an arrangement, they can either form an increasing subsequence if \\(a_i\\) comes before \\(a_j\\) or not if \\(a_j\\) comes before \\(a_i\\). Since the numbers are arranged randomly, both both case happens equally often. Therefore, on average, every pair will contribute half its occurrences to forming an increasing subsequence. There are \\(\\binom{6}{2}\\) such pairs, and since each pair contributes half its occurrences to the count of increasing subsequences, the contribution from pairs is \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\binom{6}{2}\\).\n</paragraph_2>\n\nThis paragraph is correct, but the explanation can be simplified. The key point is that each pair contributes \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\binom{6}{2}\\) to the total count.\n\n<paragraph_3>\n**Step 3: Extending to Longer Sequences**\nThis principle extends to longer sequences. For instance, for a triplet \\(a_i, a_j, a_k\\) (\\(i < j < k\\)), the probability that it forms an increasing subsequence in a random permutation is \\(\\frac{1}{3!}\\), because out of the 6 possible arrangements of these three numbers, only one is in increasing order. Similarly, for every quadruplet, quintuplet, and sextuplet, the probabilities of forming an increasing subsequence are \\(\\frac{1}{4!}\\), \\(\\frac{1}{5!}\\), and \\(\\frac{1}{6!}\\) respectively.\n</paragraph_3>\n\nThis paragraph is correct, but the explanation can be simplified. The key point is that each \\(k\\)--tuple contributes \\(\\frac{1}{k!} \\cdot \\binom{6}{k}\\) to the total count.\n\n<paragraph_4>\n**Step 4: Summing Contributions**\nSo, the expected total number of increasing subsequences across all permutations is:\n\\[ \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\binom{6}{2} + \\frac{1}{3!} \\cdot \\binom{6}{3} + \\frac{1}{4!} \\cdot \\binom{6}{4} + \\frac{1}{5!} \\cdot \\binom{6}{5} + \\frac{1}{6!} \\cdot \\binom{6}{6} \\]\n</paragraph_4>\n\nThis paragraph is correct, but the calculation can be simplified.

So, the left-hand side becomes \\(9 \\times 25 \\times 7 \\times 9\\).\n</paragraph_1>\n\nThe error is in the simplification of \\(5 \\times 5\\). It should be \\(5 \\times 5 = 25\\), not \\(5 \\times 5 = 25\\). However, this does not affect the final result as the simplification process and the solution are correct. The correct simplification should be:\n\n<paragraph_1>\nFirst, simplify the left-hand side of the equation by multiplying the numbers \\(3 \\times 3 = 9\\) and \\(5 \\times 5 = 25\\).
