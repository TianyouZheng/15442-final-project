This can be done by finding the smallest integer \\(k\\) such that \\(10^{(T-1)}} \\le 33 \\le 10^T - 1\\).\n\n### Step 3: Calculating for Specific Values of \\(T\\)\n#### For \\(T\\)-digit numbers:\n- The smallest 1-digit number is 1, and the smallest multiple of 33 is 33 itself.\n- The last two digits of 33 are 33, and their product is \\(3 \\times 3 = 9\\).\n\n#### For \\(2\\)-digit numbers:\n- The smallest 2-digit number is 10, and the smallest multiple of 33 is 33.\n- The last two digits of 33 are 33, and their product is \\(3 \\times 3 = 9\\).\n\n#### For \\(3\\)-digit numbers:\n- The smallest 3-digit number is 100, and the smallest multiple of 33 is 165.\n - The last two digits of 165 are 15, and their product is \\(1 \\times 5 = 5\\).\n\n### Step 4: Generalizing for Any \\(T\\)\nFor any \\(T\\)-digit number, the smallest multiple of 33 will be the smallest number in the range \\([10^{(T-1)}, 10^T - 1]\\) that is divisible by 33. The last two digits of this number will be the last two digits of the smallest multiple of 33 in that range.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe product of the last two digits of \\(N\\) when \\(T\\) is 3 is **5**.\n\nThe earliest error in the provided solution is in paragraph 2, where it incorrectly states the smallest 2-digit number divisible by 33 is 11, when it is 33.

However, let's review each paragraph to ensure there are no errors:\n\n<paragraph_1>\nGiven the arithmetic sequence, we express the terms as $a_{1} = a$, $a_{2} = a + d$, $a_{3} = a + 2d$, $a_{4} = a + 3d$, $a_{6} = a + 5d$. Since $a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{6}$ form a geometric sequence, we have $\\frac{a_{2}}{a_{1}} = \\frac{a_{6}}{a_{2}}$. Substituting the expressions, we get $\\frac{a + d}{a} = \\frac{a + 5d}{a + d}$. Cross-multiplying and simplifying, we obtain $(a + d)^2 = a(a + 5d)$. Expanding and rearrange terms, we get $a^2 + 2ad + d^2 = a^2 + 5ad$. Simplify further, we have $2ad + d^2 = 5ad$. Rearrange to $d^2 - 3ad = 0$. Factoring out $d$, we obtain $d(d - 3a) = 0$. This gives us two possibilities: $d = 0$ or $d = 3a$. Since $a_{1} \\neeq a_{2}$, we must have $d \\neeq  0$.

Substitute $d = 3a$ into this equation, we get $(a + 9a)^2 = a(a + (k-1)3a)$. Simplify further, we have $10^2 = a(4a + 3(k-1)a)$. Simplify to $10^2 = 4a^2 + 3ak - 3a^2$. Rearrange to $10^2 = a^2 + 3ak$. Divide both sides by $a^2$, we obtain $10^2/a^2 = 1 + 3k/a$. Since $d = 3a$, we substitute $9 = 1 + 3k/a$ to get $9 = 1 + 9$.

The last term of the arithmetic progression is given by \\(a + (n-1) \\cdot d\\), where \\(n = 15\\). Therefore, the equation becomes:\n     \\[\n     1 + 14d = 999\n     \\]\n   - Solving for \\(d\\):\n     \\[\n     14d = 998 \\implies d = \\frac{998}{14} = 71.2857\n     \\]\n   - Since \\(d\\) must be an integer, we take the largest integer less than or equal to 71.2857, which is 71.\n\n2. **Calculating the sum of the arithmetic progression:**\n   - The sum \\(S\\) of the first \\(n\\) terms of an arithmetic progression is given by:\n     \\[\n     s = \\frac{n}{2} \\left(2a + (n-1)d\\right)\n     \\]\n   - Substituting \\(n = 15\\), \\(a = 1\\), and \\(d = 71\\):\n     \\[\n     s = \\frac{15}{2} \\left(2 \\cdot 1 + (15-1) \\cdot 71\\right) = \\frac{15}{2} \\left(2 + 14 \\cdot 71\\right) = \\frac{15}{2} \\left(2 + 994\\right) = \\frac{15}{2} \\cdot 996 = 15 \\cdot 499 = 7485\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the largest possible sum of the 15 answers is \\(\\boxed{7485}\\).\n\nThe earliest error in the provided solution is in paragraph 1, where the first term \\(a\\) is incorrectly set to 5 instead of 1.", "prediction": 7485, "match": false, "label": -1}

It correctly states the plan to compute the number of digits and then the logarithm.\n\n<paragraph_1>\nFirst, we compute \\(X\\). The number of digits in the decimal expansion of any number \\(n\\) can be found using the formula \\(\\lfloor \\log_{10}n \\rfloor + 1\\). Let's apply this to \\(100^{1000^{10,000}}}\\): First, notice that \\(100 = 10^2\\), so we have \\((10^2)^{1000^{10,000}} = 10^{2 \\cdot 1000^{10,000}}\\). Therefore, the number of digits in \\(X\\) is:\n\\[X = \\lfloor \\log_{10} (10^{2 \\cdot 1000^{10,000}}) \\rfloor + 1 = \\lfloor 2 \\cdot 1000^{10,000} \\rfloor + 1.\\]\nHowever, since \\(1000^{10,000}\\) is extremely large, for our purposes, it's sufficient to say that \\(X = 2 \\cdot 1000^{10,000}\\), ignoring the \\(+1\\) because it does not significantly affect the magnitude of the result.\n</paragraph_1>\nThis paragraph has a few issues. The first issue is in the calculation of the number of digits. The correct expression for \\(X\\) should be:\n\\[X = \\lfloor 2 \\cdot 1000^{10,000} \\rfloor + 1.\\]\nThe second issue is is in the approximation. The \\(+1\\) should not be ignored because it does affect the magnitude of the result. The correct approximation should be:\n\\[X \\approx 2 \\cdot 1000^{10,000} + 1.\\]\n\n<paragraph_2>\nNext, we compute \\(Y\\). Similarly, for \\(1000^{10,000^{100,000}}}\\), notice that \\(1000 = 10^3\\), so we have \\((10^3)^{10,000^{100,000}} = 10^{3 \\cdot 10,000^{100,000}}\\). Thus, the number of digits in \\(Y\\) is:\n\\[Y = \\lfloor \\log_{10} (10^{3 \\cdot 10,000^{100,000}}) \\rfloor + 1 = \\lfloor 3 \\cdot 10,000^{100,000} \\rfloor + 1.\\]\nAgain, for our calculation, we can approximate \\(Y\\) as \\(3 \\cdot 10,000^{100,000}\\).\n</paragraph_2>\nThis paragraph has similar issues as the previous one.

Let's review the solution step by step to identify the error.\n\n1. **Identify \\( m \\) and \\( n \\):**\n   \\[ m = 9, \\quad n = 17 \\]\n   The distance from vertex \\( P \\) to the base is:\n   \\[ n - m = 17 - 9 = 8 \\]\n\n2. **Setting up the right triangle:**\n   Let the side length of the square base \\( ABCD \\) be \\( s \\). The center of the square is the point where the perpendicular from \\( P \\) to the base intersects the base. This center is also the center of the square, and the distance from the center to any vertex of the square is \\( \\frac{s\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\).\n\n3. **Applying the Pythagorean theorem:**\n   In the right triangle formed by \\( P \\), the center of the square, and a vertex of the square, the hypotenuse is \\( PA = n = 17 \\), one leg is the distance from the center to a vertex, which is \\( \\frac{s\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\), and the other other leg is the distance from the center to the base, which is 8. By the Pythagorean theorem, we have:\n   \\[ 17^2 = 8^2 + \\left( \\frac{s\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\right)^2 \\]\n\n4. **Simplifying the equation:**\n   \\[ 289 = 64 + \\frac{2s^2}{4} \\]\n   \\[ 289 = 64 + \\frac{s^2}{2} \\]\n   \\[ 289 - 64 = \\frac{s^2}{2} \\]\n   \\[ 225 = \\frac{s^2}{2} \\]\n   \\[ s^2 = 450 \\]\n\n5. **Area of the square \\( ABCD \\):**\n   \\[ \\boxed{450} \\]\n\nThe error in the original solution is in the simplification of the Pythagorean theorem equation. The correct simplification should be:\n\\[ 289 = 64 + \\frac{s^2}{2} \\]\n\\[ 225 = \\frac{s^2}{2} \\]\n\\[ s^2 = 450 \\]\n\nThus, the area of the square \\( ABCD \\) is:\n\\[ \\boxed{451} \\]\n\nThe earliest error occurs in paragraph 3, where the equation is incorrectly simplified. Therefore, the index of the paragraph where the earliest error occurs is \\boxed{3}.", "prediction": 3, "match": false, "label": -1}
