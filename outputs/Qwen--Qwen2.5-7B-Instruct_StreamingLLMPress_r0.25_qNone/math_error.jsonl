Since \\(\\angle A = 90^\\circ\\), \\(AB\\) is one leg, \\(AC\\) is the other leg, and \\(BC\\) is the hypotenuse. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the hypotenuse \\(BC\\):\n\\[ BC = \\sqrt{AB^2 + AC^2} = \\sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = \\sqrt{9 + 16} = \\sqrt{25} = 5. \\]\n- This paragraph is correct.
