First, we know that Qing is twice as old as Rayna. Let's denote Rayna's age as \\( R \\). Then, Qing's age is \\( 2R \\).\n\n[paragraph 1]\nSecond, we know that Qing is 4 years younger than Paolo. Let's denote Paolo's age as \\( P \\). Then, Qing's age can be expressed as \\( P - 4 \\). Since we already know that Qing's age is \\( 2R \\), we can set up the equation \\( 2R = P - 4 \\).\n\n[paragraph 2]\nThird, the average age of Paolo, Qing, and Rayna is 13. To find the average, we add up their ages and divide by 3. So, we have the equation \\(\\frac{P + 2R + R}{3} = 13\\). Simplifying this, we get \\(\\frac{P + 3R}{3} = 13\\). Multiplying both sides by 3, we get \\( P + 3R = 39 \\).\n\n[paragraph 3]\nNow we have two equations:\n1. \\( 2R = P - 4 \\)\n2. \\( P + 3R = 39 \\)\n\n[paragraph 4]\nWe can use substitution to solve these equations. From the first equation, we can express \\( P \\) in terms of \\( R \\): \\( P = 2R + 4 \\). Substituting this into the second equation, we get \\( (2R + 4) + 3R = 39 \\).
