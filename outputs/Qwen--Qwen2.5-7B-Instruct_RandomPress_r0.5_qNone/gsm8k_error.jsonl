It should state that the 60 new infections include the original 10, so we subtract 10 to avoid double-counting.\n- Paragraph 2: The calculation is correct, but the explanation could be clearer.

It should state that the 2160 new infections include the original 360, so we subtract 360 to avoid double-counting.\n- Paragraph 4: This is the correct final answer.\n\n### Error Identification\n- Paragraph 1: The explanation is clear, but it could be more explicit about subtracting the original 10.\n- Paragraph 2: The explanation is clear, but it could be more explicit about subtracting the original 60.\n- Paragraph 3: The explanation is clear, but it could be more explicit about subtracting the original 360.\n\n### Index of the First Error\nThe first error occurs in paragraph 1.\n\nTherefore, the index of the first error is \\boxed{1}.", "prediction": 1, "match": true, "label": 1}
