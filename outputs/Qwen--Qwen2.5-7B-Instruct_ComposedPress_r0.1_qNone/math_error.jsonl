This is correct.\n\n- **Paragraph 1**: This paragraph correctly applies Descartes' Rule of Signs to conclude that \\( p(x) \\) must have at least one positive real root. This is correct.\n\n- **Paragraph 2**: This paragraph incorrectly assumes that if \\( p(x) \\) has exactly three positive real roots, then \\( p'(x) \\) would have three positive real roots, which contradicts the fact that \\( p'(x) \\) has only one positive real root. The correct conclusion should be that \\( p(x) \\) cannot have exactly three positive real roots, but it does not necessarily mean it has exactly one positive real root. This is an error.\n\n- **Paragraph 3**: This paragraph correctly concludes that \\( a \\ge 2 \\) by using the Intermediate Value Theorem and the fact that \\( p(x) \\) cannot have more than one positive real root. This is correct.\n\n- **Paragraph 4**: This paragraph correctly identifies that \\( p(x) = (x^2 + 2x + 1)^2 \\) when \\( a = 2 \\), which means \\( p(x) \\) has a double root at \\( x = -1 \\). This is correct.\n\nThe earliest error occurs in paragraph 2. Therefore, the index of the paragraph where the earliest error occurs is 2.
