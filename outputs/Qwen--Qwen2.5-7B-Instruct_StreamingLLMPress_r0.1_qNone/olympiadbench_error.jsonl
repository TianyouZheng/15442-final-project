Notice that \\( x^2 + 7 \\) is always greater than or equal to 7 for any real value of \\( x \\).

Since 7 is a prime number, the only way to express it as a sum of squares of integers is \\( 1^2 + 2^2 \\) (since 7 cannot be expressed as a single square). However, we are looking for polynomials with rational coefficients. In this case, we can express 7 as a sum of squares of two rational numbers: \\( (\\sqrt{7})^2 = (\\sqrt{7})^2 + 0^2 \\), but this does not satisfy our requirement of having rational coefficients for the polynomials.

The cube is initially divided into \\( n^3 \\) smaller cubes of unit length. Three faces meeting at a corner are painted red.

Since \\( c \\) is a fixed constant, it can have at most a finite number of prime factors greater than \\( 10^{100} \\), which means that for sufficiently large \\( a - b \\), the number of prime factors of \\( c(a - b) \\) greater than \\( 10^{100} \\) will be equal to the number of prime factors of \\( a - b \\) greater than \\( 10^{100} \\).

Consider the behavior of \\( f \\) for large values of \\( x \\). If \\( f \\) is non-linear, then \\( f(a) - f(b) \\) can grow much faster than \\( a - b \\) as \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) increase. This means that for sufficiently large \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), the number of prime factors of \\( f(a) - f(b) \\) greater than \\( 10^{100} \\) can be greater than the number of prime factors of \\( a - b \\) greater than \\( 10^{100} \\), which contradicts the given condition.\nThis paragraph is correct.\n</paragraph_3>\n\n<paragraph_4>\nTherefore, the only strictly increasing functions \\( f: \\mathbb{Z} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{Z} \\) that satisfy the condition are of the form\n\\[ \\boxed{f(x) = cx + d} \\]\nwhere \\( c \\) and \\( d \\) are integers and \\( c > 0 \\).\nThis paragraph is correct.\n</paragraph_4>\n\n<paragraph_5>\nwhere \\( c \\) and \\( d \\) are integers and \\( c > 0 \\).\nThis paragraph is correct.\n</paragraph_5>\n\nSince all paragraphs are correct, the earliest error is at index \\(-1\\).\n\n\\boxed{-1}", "prediction": -1, "match": false, "label": 2}
