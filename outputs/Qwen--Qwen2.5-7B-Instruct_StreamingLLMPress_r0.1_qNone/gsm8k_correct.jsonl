It correctly sums the hours for each day to find the total weekly practice hours.\n\n<paragraph_3>\nTherefore, the total number of hours Hallie spends in dance practice each week is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).\n</paragraph_3>\n\nThis paragraph is correct. It correctly states the final answer.\n\nSince there are no errors in the solution, the index of the paragraph where the earliest error occurs is \\(\\boxed{-1}\\).", "prediction": -1, "match": true, "label": -1}
{"config": "gsm8k", "generated_critique": "Let's review the solution paragraph by paragraph.\n\n<paragraph_0>\nTo determine how many dishwashing cycles you can run with the new box of 100 dishwasher pods for $1, we need to follow these steps: First, calculate the number of pods in the special size box. The special size box has 20% more pods than the regular box. The regular box has 100 pods. To find 20% of 100: \\[ 20\\% \\times 100 = 0.20 \\times 100 = 20 \\] Add this to the original number of pods: \\[ 100 + 20 = 120 \\] So, the special size box contains 120 pods.\n</paragraph_0>\n\nThis paragraph is correct. The special size box contains 120 pods.\n\n<paragraph_1>\nSecond, determine the cost per pod in the special size box. The total cost for 120 pods is $12. Divide the total cost by the number of pods to find the cost per pod: \\[ \\frac{12}{120} = 0.10 \\text{ dollars per pod} \\]\n</paragraph_1>\n\nThis paragraph is also correct. The cost per pod is $0.10.\n\n<paragraph_2>\nThird, calculate the number of dishwashing cycles you can run with $1. If each pod costs $0.10, then with $1, you can buy: \\[ \\frac{1}{0.10} = 10 \\text{ pods} \\] Since you use 1 pod per cycle, the number of cycles you can run is also 10.\n</paragraph_2>\n\nThis paragraph is correct as well. With $1, you can buy 10 pods, and since you use 1 pod per cycle, you can run 10 cycles.\n\n<paragraph_3>\nTherefore, the final answer is: \\[ \\boxed{10} \\]\n</paragraph_3>\n\nThe final answer is correct.\n\nSince there are no errors in the solution, the index of the paragraph where the earliest error occurs is \\boxed{-1}.", "prediction": -1, "match": true, "label": -1}

It correctly states the initial number of cats.\n\n<paragraph_1>\nAfter the boats came, four boats each carried away 5 cats. So, in total, \\(4 \\times 5 = 20\\) cats were carried away.

To find out how many cats this is, we calculate \\(3/5\\) of 30: \\[ \\frac{3}{5} \\times 30 = 18 \\] This means 18 cats ran after a mouse.\n</paragraph_2>\n\nThis paragraph is correct.
