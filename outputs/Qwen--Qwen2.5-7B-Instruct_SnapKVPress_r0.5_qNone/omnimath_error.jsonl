A square is attacked by a queen if it is in the same row, column, or diagonal as the queen.\n</paragraph_1>\n- This paragraph is correct, but it should mention that a queen can attack any square in the same row, column, or diagonal, not just the adjacent ones.\n\n<paragraph_2>\n**Reasoning:** First, consider the attacking pattern of a queen. A queen can attack any square in the same row, column, or diagonal. The chessboard has \\(2017 \\times 2017\\) squares. To cover all squares, we need to consider the minimum number of queens required to dominate the board. The minimum number of queens required to dominate an \\(n \\times n\\) board is approximately \\(n/2\\) for large \\(n\\). For \\(2017\\), the minimum number of queens required is approximately \\(2017/2 \\approx 1008.5\\). Since we can't place half a queen, we need at least 1009 queens. Since 1000 queens are fewer than 1009, it is impossible to place 1000 queens such that every square is attacked.\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{No}} \\]\n</paragraph_2>\n- The reasoning is correct, but the problem statement in paragraph 1 should be more precise about the attacking pattern of a queen.\n\n<paragraph_3>\n**Problem:** A \\(2017 \\times 2017\\) grid of squares originally contains a 0 in each square. At any step, Kelvin the Frog chooses two adjacent squares and increments the numbers in both of them by 1. Can Kelvin make every square contain a different power of 2?\n</paragraph_3>\n- This paragraph is correct.\n\n<paragraph_4>\n**Reasoning:** First, consider the powers of 2. The powers of 2 are \\(1, 2, 4, 8, 16, \\ldots\\). The number of distinct powers of 2 is infinite, but the number of squares in the grid is \\(2017 \\times 2017\\), which is finite.

In a tournament, each player plays against every other player exactly once, and there is a winner and a loser in each game. To dominate a set of 2017 players, there must be a player who beats all 2017 players in the set. It is known that in a tournament with \\(n\\) players, there exists a player who beats at least \\(n/2\\) other players. For \\(n = 2017\\), there exists a player who beats at least \\(1008.5\\) other players. Since we can't have half a player, there exists a player who beats at least 1009 other players. Therefore, it is possible to have a tournament in which every set of 2017 players is dominated.\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Yes}} \\]\n</paragraph_6>\n- The reasoning is correct, but the problem statement in paragraph 5 should be more precise about the definition of domination.\n\n<paragraph_7>\n**Problem:** Every cell of a \\(2017 \\times 2017\\) grid is colored with one of 7 colors.

The logic of checking each number one by one to see which removal brings the sum closest to 6.1 is flawed. Instead, the correct approach is to calculate the total sum needed for the mean to be 6.1 and then determine which number, when removed, will result in that sum. The correct calculation should be as follows:\n\n1. The desired mean is 6.1, and there will be 10 numbers left after removing one. So, the total sum of the remaining numbers should be \\(6.1 \\times 10 = 61\\).\n2. The original sum of the set is 66.
