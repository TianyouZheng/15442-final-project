This is correct.\n\n#### Paragraph 2\nThe solution then considers the case \\(n = a\\). The inequality \\(n^2 - m^2 + 2mn \\le 2a(n - m)\\) simplifies to \\(a^2 - m^2 + 2am - 2a^2 \\le 2a(a - m)\\), which further simplifies to \\(-a^2 + 2am - m^2 \\le 2a^2 - 2am\\). This is correct.\n\nHowever, the solution then states that there are no integer solutions for \\(m < 2a\\) that satisfy this inequality. This is incorrect. The inequality \\(-a^2 + 2am - m^2 \\le 2a^2 - 2am\\) simplifies to \\(-a^2 + 2am - m^2 \\le 2a^2 - 2am\\), or \\(4am - 3a^2 - m^2 \\le 0^2\\). which is is a quadratic inequality in \\(m\\).

This means there are integer solutions for \\(m < 2a\\).\n\n#### Paragraph 3\nThe solution then considers the case \\(n = 2a - m\\). The inequality \\(n^2 - m^2 + 2mn \\le 2a(n - m)\\) simplifies to \\((2a - m)^2 - m^2 + 2m(2a - m) \\le 2a(2a - 2m)\\), which further simplifies to \\(4a^2 - 4am + m^2 - m^2 + 4am - 2m^2 \\le 4a^2 - 4am\\), or \\(-2m^2 \\le -4am\\), or \\(2m^2 \\ge 4am\\), or \\(m^2 \\ge 2am\\), or \\(m \\ge 2a\\).

The minimum number of queens required to dominate a \\(2017 \\times 2017\\) board is approximately \\(2017/2 \\approx 1008.5\\), and since we can't have a half queen, we need at least 1109 queens. Since 1100 is fewer than 1119, it is impossible to place 1100 queens to dominate the board. The solution is correct.\n\n### Part (b)\nThe reasoning is incorrect. The number of distinct powers of 2 up to \\(2^{20}\\) is 21, but the number of squares is \\(2017^2 = 4068289\\). However, the problem is asking if each square can contain a different power of 2, not just a different number. Since there are only 21 distinct powers of 2, it is impossible to assign a different power of 2 to each of the 4068289 squares. The solution should state that it is impossible because there are not enough distinct powers of 2, not just because there are not enough distinct numbers. The earliest error is in paragraph 4.\n\n### Part (c)\nThe reasoning is correct. By constructing a tournament where each player has a unique ranking, any set of 2017 players can be dominated by the player ranked just above the highest-ranked player in the set. The solution is correct.\n\n### Part (d)\nThe reasoning is correct. By the pigeonhole principle and Ramsey theory, in a \\(19 \\times 19\\) grid, there will always be a monochromatic rectangle. The solution is correct.\n\n### Part (e)\nThe reasoning is incorrect. The statement that \\(\\max(|A \\cdot A|, |A + A|) \\geq c|A| \\log^2 |A|\\) is not generally known to be true for all finite sets \\(A \\subset \\mathbb{Z}\\). The correct statement is that \\(\\max(|A \\cdot A|, |A + A|) \\geq c|A| \\log |A|\\) for some constant \\(c\\), but but not necessarily \\(\\log^2 |A|\\).

It correctly states that there are 36 switches (20 for rows and 16 for columns, but the problem states 36, which is is correct).\n\n#### Paragraph 1 (Index 1)\n - The paragraph is correct. It correctly explains that each state of each switch can be represented by a binary digit (0 or 1) and that each unique binary string of length 36 corresponds to a particular sequence of switch flips.\n\n#### Paragraph 2 (Index 2)\n - The paragraph contains an error. It states that \"If all switches are flipped an even number of times, the state of each lightbulb remains unchanged (all off). The same applies when all switches are flipped an odd number of times - the lightbulb's state is toggled (they could all be on, but this depends on the initial conditions we don't have).\" This is not entirely accurate. The key point is that the state of each lightbulb is determined by the parity (even or odd) of the number of times the corresponding row and column switches are flipped. If is and 16 flips will result in the lightbulb being in the same state as it was initially, but if the sum is odd, the lightbulb's state is toggled. The paragraph should clarify that the state of each lightbulb is determined by the combination of the row and column flips, not just the parity of the total flips.\n\n#### Paragraph 3 (Index 3)\n - The paragraph is correct. It correctly states that the distinct configurations arise from different combinations of row and column switches being flipped an odd number of times. The explanation that the grid's dimensions are relatively prime (21 and 16 have no common factors) is correct, and it implies that each combination of row and column switches uniquely affects the lightbulbs.\n\n#### Paragraph 4 (Index 4)\n - The paragraph is correct. It correctly explains that the total number of distinct configurations is \\(2^{35}\\) due to the symmetry of the binary states and the fact fact flipping all switches twice returns the grid to its original state.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe earliest error is found in Paragraph 2.
