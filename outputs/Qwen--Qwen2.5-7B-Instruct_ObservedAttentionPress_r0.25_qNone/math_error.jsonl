The equation of the tangent line at the point \\((a, f(a))\\) is given by:\n\\[ y - f(a) = f'(a)(x - a). \\]\nSubstituting \\( f(a) = \\frac{1}{3}a^3 - 4a + 4 \\) and \\( f'(a) = a^2 - 4 \\), we get:\n\\[ y - \\left( \\frac{1}{3}a^3 - 4a + 4 \\right) = (a^2 - 4)(x - a). \\]\nSimplifying, we get:\n\\[ y - \\frac{1}{3}a^3 + 4a - 4 = (a^2 - 4)(x - a), \\]\n\\[ y = (a^2 - 4)x - a(a^2 - 4) + \\frac{1}{3}a^3 - 4a + 4, \\]\n\\[ y = (a^2 - 4)x - a^3 + 4a + \\frac{1}{3}a^3 - 4a + 4, \\]\n\\[ y = (a^2 - 4)x - \\frac{2}{3}a^3 + 4. \\]\nSo, the equation of the tangent line is:\n\\[ \\boxed{y = (a^2 - 4)x - \\frac{2}{3}a^3 + 4}. \\]\n\n(2) To find the maximum and minimum values of the function \\( f(x) = \\frac{1}{3}x^3 - 4x + 4 \\) on the interval \\([-3, 4]\\), we need to find the critical points by setting\n?\n\u7f51\u9996\u9875\ntica\n\u6570\u5b66\n\u7ed9\u5b9a\u51fd\u6570 \\( f(x) = \\frac{1}{3}x^3 - 4x + 4\\)\u3002\n\n(1) \u627e\u51fa\u66f2\u7ebf \\(y = f(x)\\) \u5728\u70b9 \\((a, f(a))\\) \u5904\u7684\u5207\u7ebf\u65b9\u7a0b\u3002\n\n(2) \u5728\u533a\u95f4 \\([-3, 4]\\) \u4e0a\u627e\u5230\u51fd\u6570 \\(f(x)\\) \u7684\u6700\u5927\u503c\u548c\u6700\u5c0f\u503c\u3002", "prediction": null, "match": false, "label": 2}
