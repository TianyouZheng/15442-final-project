This is a classic dynamic programming problem related to tiling problems.\n- **No error.**\n\n<paragraph_1>\nFirst, we define the base cases:\n- For \\(n = 0\\), there's exactly one way to tile the rectangle (by not placing any tiles), so \\(A_0 = 1\\).\n- For \\(n = 1\\), there's only one way to tile it using a single \\(1 \\times 1\\) tile, so \\(A_1 = 1\\).\n- For \\(n = 2\\), there's also only one way to tile it (using two \\(1 \\times 1\\) tiles), so \\(A_2 = 1\\).\n- For \\(n = 3\\), there are two ways to tile it: either with three \\(1 \\times 1\\) tiles or with one \\(1 \\times 3\\) tile, so \\(A_3 = 2\\).\n- **Error: \\(A_2\\) should be 2, not 1.**\n\n<paragraph_2>\nNext, we derive the recursive relation:\nTo find \\(A_n\\) for \\(n > 3\\), consider the last tile placed:\n- If the last tile is a \\(1 \\times 1\\), then the remaining part to tile is \\(n-1\\). So, there are \\(A_{n-1}\\) ways in this case.\n- If the last tile is a \\(1 \\times 3\\), then the remaining part to tile is \\(n-3\\). So, there are \\(A_{n-3}\\) ways in this case.\nThus, the recursive relation is:\n\\[A_n = A_{n-1} + A_{n-3}\\]\n- **No error.**\n\n<paragraph_3>\nWe now calculate values of \\(A_n\\) until we find an \\(n\\) where \\(A_n \\geq K\\), where \\(K\\) is the sum of the digits of \\(T = 98721\\).\nFirst, find \\(K\\):\n\\[K = 9 + 8 + 7 + 2 + 1 = 27\\]\n- **No error.**\n\n<paragraph_4>\nNow, compute \\(A_n\\) for increasing values of \\(n\\) starting from 4:\n- \\(A_4 = A_3 + A_1 = 2 + 1 = 3\\)\n- \\(A_5 = A_4 + A_2 = 3 + 2 = 5\\)\n- \\(A_6 = A_5 + A_3 = 5 + 2 = 7\\)\n- \\(A_7 = A_6 + A_4 = 7 + 3 = 10\\)\n- \\(A_8 = A_7 + A_5 = 10 + 5 = 15\\)\n- \\(A_9 = A_8 + A_6 = 15 + 7 = 22\\)\n- \\(A_{10} = A_9 + A_7 = 22 + 10 = 32\\)\n- **No error.**\n\n<paragraph_5>\nNotice \\(A_{10} = 32\\), which is greater than \\(K = 27\\), so the smallest value of \\(n\\) such that \\(A_n \\geq K\\) is \\(n = 10\\).\n- **No error.**\n\n<paragraph_6>\nThus, the smallest value of \\(n\\) such that \\(A_n \\geq K\\) is \\(n = 10\\).\n- **No error.**\n\n<paragraph_7>\n**Answer:** The smallest value of \\(n\\) such that \\(A_n \\geq K\\) is \\(n = 10\\).\n- **No error.**\n\nThe earliest error occurs in paragraph 1, where the base case for \\(A_2\\) is incorrectly stated.\n\n\\boxed{1}", "prediction": 1, "match": false, "label": -1}
