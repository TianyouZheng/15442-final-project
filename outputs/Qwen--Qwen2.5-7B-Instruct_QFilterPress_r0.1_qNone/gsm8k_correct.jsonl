However, the problem does not specify that the girlfriend eats half of what Steve eats; it only states that Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend. Therefore, the girlfriend's daily consumption should be calculated based on the information that Steve eats twice as much, not half. The correct calculation for the girlfriend's daily consumption is \\(6 / 2 = 3\\) cherry tomatoes per day, which is correct in the given solution, but the explanation is misleading.", "prediction": 1, "match": false, "label": -1}

It provides a clear and accurate description of the process to be followed.\n\n<paragraph_1>\nFirst, let's calculate the hours Hallie practices on each day:\nFirst, on Tuesdays, Hallie practices for 1 hour.\nSecond, on Thursdays, Hallie practices for 2 hours.\nThird, on Saturdays, she practices for twice as long as she does on Tuesdays. Since she practices for 1 hour on Tuesdays, on Saturdays she practices for \\(2 \\times 1 = 2\\) hours.\n</paragraph_1>\n\nThis paragraph is also correct. It correctly identifies the hours practiced on each day and calculates the Saturday practice time accurately.\n\n<paragraph_2>\nNow, let's find the total number of hours she practices in a week by summing the hours for each day:\n\\[ \\text{Total hours per week} = (\\text{Hours on Tuesday}) + (\\text{Hours on Thursday}) + (\\text{Hours on Saturday}) \\]\n\\[ \\text{Total hours per week} = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5 \\]\n</paragraph_2>\n\nThis paragraph is correct.
