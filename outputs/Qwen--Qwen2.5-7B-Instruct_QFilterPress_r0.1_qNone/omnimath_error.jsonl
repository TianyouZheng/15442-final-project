A \\( 1 \\times 1 \\) table has only one square. Placing a chip in this square results in a sparse arrangement because there are no \\( 2 \\times 2 \\) squares to check. However, there are no free squares to move the chip to, so this arrangement satisfies the condition. Therefore, \\( n = 1 \\) is possible.\n- This paragraph is correct. The \\( 1 \\times 1 \\) table is indeed sparse and any move of the chip is not possible, so it satisfies the condition.\n\n<paragraph_2>\nSecond, consider the case \\( n = 2 \\). A \\( 2 \\times 2 \\) table has four squares. Placing a chip in each of the four squares results in a sparse arrangement because each \\( 2 \\times 2 \\) square contains exactly 4 chips, which violates the condition. Therefore, we need to place fewer than 4 chips. If we place 3 chips in the table, there is always at least one free square where we can move a chip without violating the sparsity condition. Therefore, \\( n = 2 \\) is not possible.\n- This paragraph contains an error. Placing a chip in each of the four squares does not result in a sparse arrangement because each \\( 2 \\times 2 \\) square contains exactly 4 chips, which violates the condition. However, placing 3 chips in the table does not necessarily mean there is always a free square where we can move a chip without violating the sparsity condition. For example, if we place chips in the top-left, top-right, and bottom-left squares, the top-right square is free, but moving the chip from the top-right to the bottom-right would result in a sparse arrangement. Therefore, \\( n = 2 \\) is not possible is not correct.\n\n<paragraph_3>\nThird, consider the case \\( n = 3 \\). A \\( 3 \\times 3 \\) table has nine squares. Placing a chip in each of the nine squares results in a sparse arrangement because each \\( 2 \\times 2 \\) square contains at most 4 chips. However, if we remove one chip, there is always at least one free square where we can move the removed chip without violating the sparsity condition. Therefore, \\( n = 3 \\) is not possible.\n- This paragraph contains an error. Placing a chip in each of the nine squares does not result in a sparse arrangement because each \\( 2 \\times 2 \\) square contains exactly 4 chips, which violates the condition. Therefore, \\( n = 3 \\) is not possible is not correct.\n\n<paragraph_4>\nFourth, consider the case \\( n = 4 \\). A \\( 4 \\times 4 \\) table has sixteen squares. Placing a chip in each of the sixteen squares results in a sparse arrangement because each \\( 2 \\times 2 \\) square contains exactly 4 chips, which violates the condition. Therefore, we need to place fewer than 16 chips. If we place 15 chips in the table, there is always at least one free square where we can move a chip without violating the sparsity condition. Therefore, \\( n = 4 \\) is not possible.\n- This paragraph contains an error. Placing a chip in each of the sixteen squares does not result in a sparse arrangement because each \\( 2 \\times 2 \\) square contains exactly 4 chips, which violates the condition. Therefore, \\( n = 4 \\) is not possible is not correct.\n\n<paragraph_5>\nFinally, consider the general case \\( n \\geq 5 \\). For \\( n \\geq 5 \\), we can consider a specific arrangement of chips. Place chips in all squares except the last row and the last column. This arrangement has \\( (n-1)^2 \\) chips. Each \\( 2 \\times 2 \\) square in this arrangement contains at most 3 chips, so it is sparse. If we move a chip from any square to any free square, the new \\( 2 \\times 2 \\) square containing the moved chip will now contain 4 chips, violating the sparsity", "prediction": null, "match": false, "label": 3}

Since \\(f(x) = (x + 1)^2\\), applying \\(f\\) once gives us \\((x + 1)^2\\), applying it twice gives us \\(((x + 1)^2 + 1)^2 = (x + 2)^4\\), and so on. In general, after \\(n\\) applications of \\(f\\), we have: \\[g(x) = ((x + 1)^2)^n = (x + 1)^{2^n}\\]\n</paragraph_1>\n\nThe paragraph 1 contains an error.

The correct form after \\(n\\) applications is \\((x + n)^{2^n}\\).\n\n<paragraph_2>\nNow, let's express \\((x + 1)^{2^n}\\) in its expanded form. Using the binomial theorem, we know: \\[(x + 1)^{2^n} = \\sum_{k=0}^{2^n} \\binom{2^n}{k} x^k\\] We're specifically interested in the coefficient of the \\(x^{2^{2009}-1}\\) term, which corresponds to \\(k = 2^{2009} - 1\\).

The correct form should be \\((x + 2009)^{2^{2009}}\\).\n\n<paragraph_3>\nThus, the coefficient \\(a_{2^{2009}-1}\\) is given by: \\[a_{2^{2009}-1} = \\binom{2^{2009}}{2^{2009} - 1}\\] By Pascal's Rule, which states \\(\\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n}{k} \\binom{n-1}{k-1}\\), and knowing that \\(\\binom{n}{k} = \\binom{n}{n-k}\\), we can see that: \\[\\binom{2^{2009}}{2^{2009} - 1} = \\binom{2^{2009}}{1} = 2^{2009}\\]\n</paragraph_3>\n\nThe paragraph 3 is correct in its application of Pascal's Rule, but the binomial coefficient is based on the incorrect form of \\(g(x)\\).\n\n<paragraph_4>\nTherefore, the coefficient \\(a_{2^{2009}-1}\\) is \\(2^{2009}\\).
