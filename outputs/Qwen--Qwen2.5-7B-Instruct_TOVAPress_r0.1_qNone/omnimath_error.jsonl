A more rigorous approach would be to use the pigeonhole principle directly. Here is a more detailed explanation:\n\n1. **Paragraph 0**: Correct.

Selecting 1006 rows and 1006 columns does not guarantee that all 3000 checkers are covered. The correct approach is to use the pigeonhole principle: if we select \\( k \\) rows and \\( k \\) columns, the number of uncovered checkers is at most \\( (2011 - k)^2 \\). For \\( k = 1006 \\), the number of uncovered checkers is at most \\( (2011 - 1006)^2 = 1005^2 = 1010025 \\), which is much larger than 3000.

The correct \\( k \\) is actually 1006, but the argument in paragraph 2 is not rigorous.\n4. **Paragraph 3**: The argument is not fully rigorous. The correct approach is to use the pigeonhole principle directly: if we select \\( k \\) rows and \\( k \\) columns, the number of uncovered checkers is at most \\( (2011 - k + 1)^2 \\).
