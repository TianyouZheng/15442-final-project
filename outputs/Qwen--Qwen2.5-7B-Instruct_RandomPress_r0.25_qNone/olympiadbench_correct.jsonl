The value \\( z = -\\frac{3}{2} \\) is not valid because it is not positive. However, the correct simplification and solving of the quadratic equation should lead to the valid positive solution.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the steps leading to the quadratic equation and the solution:\n\nIn paragraph 11, the step where \\( z = y^{1 - \\log_2(3)}} = 2 \\) is correct. However, the simplification and solving of the quadratic equation should be rechecked:\n\nThe quadratic equation is:\n\\[ z^2 - z - 6 = 0 \\]\nThe solutions are:\n\\[ z = 2 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad z = -\\frac{3}{2} \\]\nSince \\( z = 2^{\\log_2(3) - 1} \\) must be positive, we discard \\( z = -\\frac{3}{2} \\). and keep \\( z = 2 \\).\n\nThen, we have:\n\\[ 2^{\\log_2(3) - 1} = 2 \\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[ \\log_2(3) - 1 = 1 \\]\n\\[ \\log_2(3) = 2 \\]\nThis is incorrect, as \\(\\log_2(3) \\ne 2\\).
