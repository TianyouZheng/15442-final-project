First, we are given the point \\((-8,6)\\) in a coordinate system. Second, we want to find the distance from the origin \\((0,)\\) to this point. To do this, we can use the distance formula, which is: \\(\\sqrt{(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2}\\) where \\((x1, y1)\\) is the origin \\((0,)\\) and \\((x2, y2)\\) is the point \\((-8,6)\\).\n</paragraph_0>\n\n[paragraph_1]\nPlugging in the values, we get: \\(\\sqrt{(-8 - 0)^2 + (6 - 0)^2}\\) = \\(\\sqrt{(-8)^2 + (6)^2}\\) = \\(\\sqrt{64 + 36}\\) = \\(\\sqrt{100}\\) = 10.\n</paragraph_1>\n\n[paragraph_2]\nTherefore, the number of units in the distance from the origin to the point \\((-8,6)\\) is \\(\\boxed{10}\\).\n</paragraph_2>\n\nReviewing the solution:\n\n1.
