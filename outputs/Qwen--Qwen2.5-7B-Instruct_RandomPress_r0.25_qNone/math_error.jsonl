Let's go through the solution step by step to identify the earliest error.\n\n<paragraph_0>\nFirst, notice that \\(x^2 - 4\\) can be factored into \\((x+2)(x-2)\\). So, the equation \\(\\frac{x^2-3}{x+2} = \\frac{2x}{x^2-4}\\) can be rewritten as \\(\\frac{x^2-3}{x+2} = \\frac{2x}{(x+2)(x-2)}\\). The error here is is the missing sign in the numerator \\(x^2 - 3\\). It should be \\(\\frac{x^2 - 3}{x+2} = \\frac{2x}{(x+2)(x-2)}\\).\n\n<paragraph_1>\nNext, we cross-multiply the two sides of the equation: \\((x^2 - 3)(x-2) = 2x(x+2)\\). The error here is is the missing sign in the numerator \\(x^2 - 3\\). It should be \\((x^2 - 3)(x-2) = 2x(x+2)\\).\n\n<paragraph_2>\nWe then expand both sides of the equation: \\(x^3 - 2x^2 - 3x + 6 = 2x^2 + 4x\\). Simplify by moving all terms to one side: \\(x^3 - 4x^2 - 7x + 6 = 0\\). The error here is is the missing sign in the term \\(-3x\\). It should be \\(-7x\\).\n\n<paragraph_3>\nThe resulting cubic equation is: \\(x^3 - 4x^2 - 7x + 6 = 0\\). To solve this cubic equation, we can try to factor it or use numerical methods. However, for this specific case, let's try to factor by grouping or synthetic division. Notice that \\(x = 1\\) is a solution (we can check this by plugging \\(x = 1\\) into the original equation). Therefore, \\(x - 1\\) is a factor of our cubic polynomial. Using synthetic division or polynomial long division with \\(x - 1\\), we get \\(x^3 - 4x^2 - 7x + 6 = (x - 1)(x^2 - 3x - 6)\\). The error here is is the missing sign in the term \\(-3x\\). It should be \\(-7x\\).\n\n<paragraph_4>\nWe need to factor the quadratic equation \\(x^2 - 3x - 6\\). This does not factor nicely, so we can use the quadratic formula where \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = -3\\), and \\(c = -6\\): \\(x = \\frac{-(-3) \\pm \\sqrt{(-3)^2 - 4(1)(-6)}}{2(1)}\\). Simplifying this, we get \\(x = \\frac{3 \\pm \\sqrt{9 + 24}}{2} = \\frac{3 \\pm \\sqrt{33}}{2}\\).
