The problem statement does not provide enough information to directly calculate the value of \\(d\\). The diagram and the context suggest that the problem might be related to a geometric figure, but the solution directly jumps to a numerical answer without \\(\\boxed{10}\\), without without the correct value of \\(d\\) is not derived from the given information. The correct approach would be to identify the geometric figure and use the properties of that figure to find the value of \\(d\\).
