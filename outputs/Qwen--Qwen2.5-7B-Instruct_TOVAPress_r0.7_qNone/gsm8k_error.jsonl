A month typically has 30 days, not 30. However, since the problem does not specify which month, we can assume it is a 30-day month for the sake of the problem. The error is more about the number of days in a month rather than a mathematical or logical error in the solution process.

Specifically, the problem asks for the number of dogs Jamal has, and the solution incorrectly uses the variable \\(B\\) for Brittany's dogs, which is is not defined in the problem. The correct approach should be to use the information given about Jamal's dogs and the relationship to Brittany's dogs to find the number of dogs Jamal has.
