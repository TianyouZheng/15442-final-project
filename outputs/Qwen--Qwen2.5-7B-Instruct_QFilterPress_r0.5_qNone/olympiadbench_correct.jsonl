However, the challenge is to avoid turning off switches that have already been turned on, which complicates the problem.**\n\n   - This understanding is correct, but it could be more precise. The key is to ensure that all switches are turned on without turning any off, which is a more specific challenge.\n\n2. **Initial Strategy: A naive approach might be to randomly flip switches each minute, but this won't necessarily minimize the number of rounds. Instead, we need a more strategic approach.**\n\n   - This is a good point, but the solution should specify the strategic approach more clearly.\n\n3. **Analyzing Possible Strategies: One strategy is to flip three new switches each minute until all switches have been flipped at least once. Then, maintain the state by flipping the same three switches each minute.**\n\n   - This is a good strategy, but it needs to be more detailed. Specifically, after the first round, Elizabeth should ensure that she does not turn off any switches that are already on.\n\n4. **Evaluating the Strategy: In the first round, Elizabeth can flip any 3 switches. In the second round, she can flip the remaining 3 switches to ensure all are on. From the third round onwards, she can maintain the state by flipping the same 3 switches each minute.**\n\n   - This is correct, but it could be more precise. After the first two rounds, Elizabeth should ensure that she does not turn off any switches that are already on. This means she needs to carefully choose which switches to flip to maintain the on state.\n\n5. **Conclusion: Given the above strategy, \\( E(6,3) = 2 \\).
