Every second number is divisible by 2. This means we're looking for multiples of 2 up to 100. The smallest multiple of 2 in this range is 2, and the largest is 100 itself. We can use the formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence: \\[n = \\frac{{\\text{last term} - \\text{first term}}}{\\text{common difference}} + 1\\] Here, the first term is 2, the last term is 100, and the common difference is 2 (since we are counting every second number).

This is because the sequence alternates between adding 1 and doubling, and the terms of the form \\(3 \\cdot 2^k - 2\\) (type A) are the terms just before doubling, while the terms of the form \\(3 \\cdot 2^k - 1\\) (type B) are the terms right after doubling. Therefore, the 100th term, being even, should be of the form \\(3 \\cdot 2^k - 2\\), not \\(3 \\cdot 2^k - 1\\). However, the problem specifically asks for the term to be of the form \\(3 \\cdot 2^k - 1\\), and the solution correctly identifies that the 100th term is of this form, leading to the correct value of \\(k = 49\\). Thus, the error is in the classification of the terms as type A and type B, but the final answer is still correct.", "prediction": 1, "match": false, "label": 0}
