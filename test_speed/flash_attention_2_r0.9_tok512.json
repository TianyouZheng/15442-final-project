        "The solution provided in the document is quite detailed and requires a step-by-step analysis to identify any potential errors. However, upon a careful review, the solution does not contain any explicit errors that would invalidate the conclusion. The main task is to identify the smallest \\( n \\) such that \\( P(n) \\) (the number of permutations of \\([n]\\) satisfying the given condition) is a multiple of 2010. \n\nThe key points to consider are:\n1. The condition \\( ka_k \\) being a perfect square for all \\( k \\) from 1 to \\( n \\).\n2. The prime factorization of 2010, which is \\( 2 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\times 67 \\).\n\nThe solution provided does not contain any explicit errors. The reasoning is sound, and the steps are logically consistent. The smallest \\( n \\) such that \\( P(n) \\) is a multiple of 2010 is derived correctly. \n\nThe smallest \\( n \\) that satisfies the condition is \\( n = 67 \\). This is because to have \\( P(n) \\) as a multiple of 2010, \\( n \\) must be large enough to accommodate the prime factors \\( 2, 3, 5, \\) and \\( 67 \\) in the permutations. \n\nThus, the smallest \\( n \\) such that \\( P(n) \\) is a multiple of 2010 is \\(\\boxed{67}\\).",
