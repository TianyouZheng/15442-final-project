        "The correct answer is that the smallest number of edges, \\( n \\), such that any subset of edges results in a monochromatic edge is \\( 17 \\). This is derived from the Ramsey number, which states that in any partition of a complete graph, there exists a monochromatic edge if the number of edges is exactly \\( 17 \\).\n\nThe detailed explanation is as follows:\n\n1. The Ramsey number for a complete graph with 17 edges is \\( 17 \\). This means that if we color exactly 17 edges, any subset of these edges results in a monochromatic edge.\n2.
