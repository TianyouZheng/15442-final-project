        "The solution provided seems to follow a logical approach, but there are a few points that could be clarified for better understanding. Let's break down the reasoning step by step:\n\n1. **Divisibility by 7 and 9**: A number is divisible by 63 if and only if it is divisible by both",
        "Based on the provided information, the earliest error in the provided problem statement is at the index 0. However, since the problem statement is correct, the index of the first error is 0. Therefore, the answer is \\(\\boxed{0}\\). \n\nIf there is a misunderstanding or if the problem statement needs",
        "Let's analyze the problem step by step to identify the issue in the provided solution.\n\nThe problem is to find the smallest \\( n \\) such that \\( P(n) \\) is a multiple of 2010, where \\( P(n) \\) is the number of permutations of the set \\([1",
        "To address the problem, let's analyze the solution step by step.\n\nThe solution starts with the observation that for \\(100\\%\\) correctness, we need to identify the probability \\(p\\) such that there exists an integer \\(a_m\\) satisfying the given conditions.\n\nThe solution proceeds with the following points:\n\n1"
