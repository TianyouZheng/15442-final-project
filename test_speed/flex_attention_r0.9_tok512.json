We can achieve this by letting the sum of any 2003 of the 4004 integers be not divisible by 2003.\n\nThe solution then proceeds as follows:\n\n1. We need to find 4004 integers such that the sum of any 2003 of them is not divisible by 2003.\n2. We can achieve this by letting the sum of any 2003 of the 4004 integers be not divisible by 2003.\n3. To construct such a set, we can let the 4004 integers be 1 modulo 2003. That is, let the 4004 integers be of the form \\(1, 1, \\ldots, 1\\) modulo 2003.\n4. Therefore, the sum of any 2003 of these integers is \\(2003 \\cdot 1 + 2003 \\cdot 1 + \\ldots + 2003 \\cdot 1 \\equiv 2003 \\cdot 1 \\pmod{2003}\\).\n5. Since 2003 is not divisible by 2003, the sum of any 2003 of these integers is not divisible by 2003.\n\nThe solution then concludes that we can find 4004 integers such that the sum of any 2003 of them is not divisible by 2003 by letting the 4004 integers be 1 modulo 2003.\n\nNow, let's carefully analyze the solution:\n\nThe key step is to let the 4004 integers be 1 modulo 2003. This means that the 4004 integers are of the form \\(1, 1, \\ldots, 1\\) modulo 2003.\n\nThe sum of any 2003 of these integers is \\(2",
