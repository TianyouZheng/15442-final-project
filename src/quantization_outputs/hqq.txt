 Sure! Here is an example of how you could write a `fib` function in Python:
```
def fib(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
```
This function uses recursion to calculate the `n`th Fibonacci number. The base case is when `n` is 1 or less, in which case the function returns `n` directly. Otherwise, the function calls itself with `n-1` and `n-2` as arguments, and

Certainly! Below is a simple implementation of the Fibonacci function in Python using both an iterative and a recursive approach.

### Iterative Approach
```python
def fib_iterative(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    
    a, b = 0, 1
    for _ in range(2, n + 1):
        a, b = b, a + b
    return b
```

### Recursive Approach
```python
def fib_recursive(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return 0
    elif n
